MilitaryDashboardApp is a real-time tactical dashboard built with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that simulates and visualizes military unit operations on a live map interface. It allows users to deploy units, assign destinations, and track movement across geographic locations. The application leverages the GMap.NET library for interactive map rendering and follows the MVVM design pattern for maintainable and scalable development.

Unit Management Panel

Mission Planning
Create and assign missions using a dedicated mission planner interface, with toast notifications on assignment(still working on).

Simulated Movement System
Units smoothly march toward assigned destinations with real-time updates using a custom DispatcherTimer simulation loop (still working on).
